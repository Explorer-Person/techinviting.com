# TechInviting Frontend (Next.js)

This repository contains a basic Next.js frontend converted from the previous static site. The project uses React and TypeScript.

## Development

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The original static files remain in the repository for reference under `index.html`, `css/`, and `js/`.
